In this folder is the updated Skier inventory. I pulled this folder from the following address:

C:\SPTarkov\Aki_Data\Server\database\traders\C:\SPTarkov\Aki_Data\Server\database\traders\58330581ace78e27b8b10cee


The only thing that was modified was the 'assort' file (assort.json), 
which contains Skier's item list, prices and trader level requirements. 
I have included a second file ('New Mod Items ONLY [not formatted!]')
that contains just the relevant new sequences for the assort.json file. 

Referencing the Skier trader assort file, you should be able to list your items 
under any other trader and tweak the prices/trader levels as you please. 


***I am 99.999% sure that these files are not properly formatted for your mod, 
so don't just drop these files into your mod folder and post them.
